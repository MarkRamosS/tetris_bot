# Tetris bot
A simple tetris AI written in JS that I found in my archive. It was a good exercise for learning the basics of setting up a tetris game in JS and interracting with the user.

The parameters (a,b,c,d) are used to evaluate a next position by (hotal height, row count, hole count, bumpiness) respectively. Then, moving the piece to the best column and rotating it, we can achieve said position. 

The parameters are trained for longevity. Meaning that the bot almost can't lose. 

Try it for yourself. Get the code and run the html on a live server. Press down to start the AI or comment line 217 to play yourself :)
